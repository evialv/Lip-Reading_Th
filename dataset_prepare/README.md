## Dataset

The folder includes audio and video python scripts, which transfroms .mp4 to correponding audio and video streams.

The results obtained with the proposed model on the [LRW dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/lip_reading/lrw1.html). The coordinates for cropping mouth ROI are suggested as (x1, y1, x2, y2) = (80, 116, 175, 211) in Matlab. Please note that the fixed cropping mouth ROI (FxHxW) = [:, 115:211, 79:175] in python.
